# Neural Networks MNIST Image Classifier 
This is a simple convolutional neural network to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 - 9) from the MNIST dataset. 
The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, 0 - 9. 
Each image is 28Ã—28 pixels in size with only a single channel. 
It also includes labels for each example, a number indicating the actual digit (0 - 9) handwritten in that image.

The following shows some example images from the MNIST dataset:
